## Overview

This repository provides production-ready, reusable GitHub Actions workflows that can be called from other repositories to standardize and simplify your CI/CD pipelines. These workflows are designed to be modular, secure, and easy to integrate into your existing projects.

### Key Features

- **Docker Operations**: Build, scan, push, and deploy Docker images
- **AWS Integration**: Deploy to AWS using Terraform, CodeBuild, CloudFormation, and more
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security checks for dependencies, containers, and infrastructure
- **Code Quality**: Linting and formatting for multiple languages and file types
- **Automation**: Dependabot auto-merge, PR management, and release automation

## Prerequisites

To use these reusable workflows, you'll need:

- GitHub repository with Actions enabled
- Appropriate secrets configured in your repository (e.g., `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN`)
- Required permissions for the specific workflow you're using

## Usage

To use a reusable workflow in your repository, create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/my-workflow.yml`) and reference the desired workflow:

```yaml
name: My Workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  docker-build-and-push:
    uses: dceoy/gh-actions-for-devops/.github/workflows/docker-build-and-push.yml@main
    with:
      registry: docker.io
      registry-user: myusername
      image-name: my-app
      context: .
    secrets:
      DOCKER_TOKEN: ${{"{{"}} secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN {{"}}"}}
```

## Reusable Workflows

The workflows are organized by category for easier navigation. Each workflow is designed to be called from other repositories using the `workflow_call` trigger.

### All Reusable Workflows

- [.github/workflows/](.github/workflows/)
{% for f in workflows %}
  - [{{ f.file }}](.github/workflows/{{ f.file }})
    - {{ f.name }}
{% endfor %}
