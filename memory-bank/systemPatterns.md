# System Patterns

*This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns in use, component relationships, and critical implementation paths.*

## System Architecture

*(Provide a high-level overview of the system's structure. Diagrams (e.g., Mermaid) can be useful here.)*

## Key Technical Decisions

*(List significant architectural or technical choices made and the reasoning behind them.)*

## Design Patterns

*(Describe the major design patterns employed throughout the codebase.)*

## Component Relationships

*(Explain how different parts of the system interact with each other. Diagrams can be helpful.)*

## Critical Implementation Paths

*(Highlight key workflows or data flows within the system that are essential to understand.)*
