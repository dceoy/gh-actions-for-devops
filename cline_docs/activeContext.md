Initializing the memory bank for the `gh-actions-for-devops` project. This involves:

1. Creating the required memory bank files in the `cline_docs/` directory

3. Setting up a foundation for future development work

## Recent Changes

- Created the `cline_docs/` directory
- Added `productContext.md` with information about the project's purpose and features
- Currently adding other required memory bank files

## Next Steps

1. Complete the memory bank initialization by creating all required files:
   - ✅ productContext.md
   - ✅ activeContext.md (this file)
   - ⬜ systemPatterns.md
   - ⬜ techContext.md
   - ⬜ progress.md

2. Potential future tasks:
   - Review existing workflows for improvements or updates
   - Add new workflows for additional DevOps tasks
   - Enhance documentation with usage examples
   - Add tests for workflows
   - Update dependencies and action versions

## Current Focus

The current focus is on establishing a complete understanding of the project through proper documentation in the memory bank. This will enable more effective development and maintenance of the GitHub Actions workflows in the future.
